**Vision**
  
  Classically-trained song editors have produced many songs, including hymns, which generate guitar chords 
that guitarists don’t want to play. This is because there is a strong disconnect between how these classical composers 
view music and the way that modern guitarists view music. The guitar chords used for a song often sound bad played 
with piano accompaniment because they have been oversimplified to match keyboard harmonization. Some problems 
are that harmonies don’t match up closely, and then the piece sounds bad. Other times, the guitar arrangements are 
too simple or complicated to be effective. Guitars are extremely common in worship settings, and because of this, it 
is important to have suitable guitar chords available. Our goal is to automatically generate guitar chords for these 
different situations.

  The solution I have provided generates guitar chords with a given score with about 75% accuracy. Accuracy was 
determined by a chord by chord comparison.I used a machine learning system to implement this solution. The software 
that we will be using is Music21 for reading, processing and writing MusicXML files and Neural Machine Translation(NMT) 
for the machine learning.
