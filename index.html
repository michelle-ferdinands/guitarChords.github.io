  <h1>Machine Learning and Music</h1>
  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>Classically-trained song editors have produced many songs, including hymns, which generate guitar chords that guitarists don’t
    want to play. This is because there is a strong disconnect between how these classical composers view music and the way that 
    modern guitarists view music. The guitar chords used for a song often sound bad played with piano accompaniment because they 
    have been oversimplified to match keyboard harmonization. Some problems are that harmonies don’t match up closely, and then 
    the piece sounds bad. Other times, the guitar arrangements are too simple or complicated to be effective. Guitars are 
    extremely common in worship settings, and because of this, it is important to have suitable guitar chords available. Our goal 
    is to automatically generate guitar chords for these different situations.

  </p>
  <p>
    The solution I have provided generates guitar chords with a given score with about 75% accuracy. Accuracy was determined by a 
    chord by chord comparison. I used a machine learning system to implement this solution. The softwares used were Music21 for 
    reading, processing and writing MusicXML files and Neural Machine Translation(NMT) for the machine learning.</p>
